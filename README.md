# Sorting-App-CS
An app where the user can perform a selection of sorting algorithms on an array of randomly generated integers.

Currently a work in progress, the end goal is to have a visualisation of the algorithms taking place. The user can generate
an array of 10 integers using the 'New List' button, then select one of the algorithm buttons to see the sorting and the final arrangement.
